# GeckoLoader
Alternative Launcher For Gex PC


For the GOG version (is there even other versions?)

A small project because I wanted to see what all levels existed in the PC version. It injects some extra memory to store a custom level list for the level select menu(s) to display in place of the originals.

I also added the ability to re-enable debugging menu options for a framerate counter and the VRAM viewer.

The entire list of levels, alongside some research comments, can be found in levels.cs.

There are a couple more menu options as well in MainWindow.xaml.cs, but they are commented out as they don't appear to have any function in the shipped version of the game.
